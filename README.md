## Projects

## [Uber Dashboard](https://github.com/AbdulrahmanAhmed66/Uber_Dashboard)
### 📄 Description
This **Uber Operations Dashboard** project demonstrates how I used **Power BI** to transform raw ride request data into an interactive and insightful analytics solution.

The goal was to diagnose operational inefficiencies, uncover critical supply-demand imbalances, and identify driver performance gaps to support **strategic business decisions** in fleet allocation, driver incentives, and customer service quality.

- 🔹 **Data Preparation** → Imported and cleansed raw Uber operational data using **Power Query**, resolving inconsistencies and ensuring data accuracy.
- 🔹 **Data Modeling** → Built a structured data model by establishing relationships between fact tables (Ride Requests) and dimension tables (Drivers, Date, Time, Location).
- 🔹 **DAX Measures** → Created custom measures for key KPIs (Completion Rate, Unfulfillment Rate) and dynamic time-based analysis to track hourly and daily trends.
- 🔹 **Dashboard Design** → Built two interconnected, interactive dashboards for Performance Overview and Supply-Demand Analysis with slicers, filters, and drill-through visuals.

> 💡 This project strengthened my **Power BI development skills** and demonstrated how organizations can leverage **data-driven insights** to optimize operations, monitor performance, and capture an estimated $2.8M in potential revenue.
